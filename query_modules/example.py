    This example procedure returns 4 fields.

      * `args` is a copy of arguments passed to the procedure.
      * `vertex_count` is the number of vertices in the database.
      * `avg_degree` is the average degree of vertices.
      * `props` is the properties map of the passed in `required_arg`, if it is
        an Edge or a Vertex. In case of a Path instance, properties of the
        starting vertex are returned.

    Any errors can be reported by raising an Exception.

    The procedure can be invoked in openCypher using the following calls:
      CALL example.procedure(1, 2) YIELD args, vertex_count;
      MATCH (n) CALL example.procedure(n, 1) YIELD * RETURN *;

    Naturally, you may pass in different arguments or yield different fields.
